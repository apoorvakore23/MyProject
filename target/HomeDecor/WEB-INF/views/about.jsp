				<p><img src="assets/images/living5.jpg" alt="" class="img-circle pull-right"  width="300" > </p><p class="first">Home Decor offers a unique selection of stylish, contemporary, and chic furniture online. Our online furniture range includes sofas, beds, dining tables, TV units, wardrobes, dressing tables, and lots more. All our wooden furniture designs are available online at homedecore.com. On our portal, you can browse as many furniture designs across categories as you like, sort and filter, compare options, easily select and buy the ones you like, and stay updated about new and contemporary designs.</p>
					<p>Furniture is what turns your house into a home. Well-designed furniture is not just functional or utilitarian (for example, tables and desks for work or cabinets and wardrobes for storage) but also a reflection of your taste and style. We have hundreds of furniture designs in solid wood, engineered wood, metal, etc., as well as soft furnishings and home decor items.</p>

<p>As an online furniture company, we know that service is as important as our products. That's why we pay attention to every detail of the process, from the time of ordering till your order reaches your home, and even afterwards.</p>

<p>The furniture you choose for a room can make or break it. The furniture designs you choose are what determine the personality of the room and say something about the inhabitants of the house. Modern furniture design is all about finding the right balance between design and functionality, while traditional designs have evolved over time, reflecting the fashion fads of each period. Whether you are on the lookout for modern designs or more traditional styles, there are some features to keep an eye out for.</p>

<p>Before you shop for home furniture designs, the first step is to picture the fully furnished rooms in your mind. What do you want each space to be used for? Will it be a private space, for family, or for entertaining? Secondly, consider the layout of each space, including the position of doors and windows, to understand how many and how big your furniture pieces can be, while still leaving enough room for people to walk around unobstructed.</p>

<p>If you have a large space, you have the luxury of adding a number of the latest furniture designs to the room, without overcrowding it, of course. For smaller rooms, it’s best that you look for multifunctional furniture designs that let you do more without taking up a lot of room. Once you identify what your room is going to be used for and what pieces you would like to furnish it with, you can proceed to find the right pieces online.</p>

<p>Many furniture purchases are for a lifetime, or at the very least, for a decade. For instance, sofa sets, beds, dining table sets, wardrobes and everything else that will be used often and roughly. Look for sturdy pieces and thoughtful design when you shop for these. Vanity or accent pieces or home decor items can be chosen more for their aesthetic appeal than their utility. Since these would be smaller buys, changing them frequently will not set you back by a lot, but at the same time, give your home a mini-makeover.</p>

<p>Portability is another key factor to consider when you shop for living room furniture designs or bedroom furniture designs. Bulky pieces like sofas and beds, if dismantlable, become extremely easy to pack and move if you need to relocate. In fact, most new furniture designs cater specifically to this need, and some are so simple that you don’t need even a carpenter’s assistance to disassemble them.</p>

<p>The quality of wood used in wooden furniture designs is a point of concern for any furniture shopper. Any interior furniture design made out of wood should have meet certain quality standards. All our furniture go through at least three rounds of quality checks and the solid wood furniture designs come with a lifetime warranty against borers. Whether you’re shopping for your entire home, or for something specific like TV furniture or wall furniture designs, our catalogue of thoughtful and eclectic designs will not disappoint.</p>
